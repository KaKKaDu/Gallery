# Gallery
This project main target is to learn as much of **javascript** and **jquery** in aspect of interacting with website layout and page elements as possible.
The main idea is to create an **interact gallery**, where you can make your own libraries, add some photos (from local files) etc. In short, I'ma make normal gallery app unless you reload the page)
That's planned to connect **firebase** in the future, but now the main target is to finish work with javascript features.
## What I've already learnt?
### Creating elements by interacting with the page (libraries in this case)
I used function **appendChild** in combination with some vars
___
```javascript

```
